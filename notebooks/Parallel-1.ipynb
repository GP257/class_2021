    "## Calculating pi\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to caculate pi. One of the more interesting is to use random numbers.  Imagine drawing $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a circle centered at zero with a radius of 1 in a the plane bounded by the x and y axis and $x=1$ and $y=1$. The area of the $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the circle is $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{4}= \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ with the area of the entire domain being is 1. If we select a random location in the plane we should have a $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ chance of being inside the circle.  The more random guesses we test to see if we are inside the circle the better our estimate of $\\pi$. The following function demonstrates the concept. Note that I am going to write the function using numba to improve speed."
